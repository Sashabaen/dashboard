A recursive case — where the function calls itself with a simpler input\n\nExample: calculating factorial\n```\nfunction factorial(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return 1;        // base case\n  return n * factorial(n - 1);  // recursive case\n}\n```',

This enables the function to be repeated several times, as it can call itself during its execution. Recursion is often used for tasks that can be defined in terms of similar subtasks. It is important to define a base condition to prevent infinite recursion. Common applications include tree traversal, sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort, and mathematical computations like Fibonacci sequences.',
